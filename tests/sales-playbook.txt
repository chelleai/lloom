Blurbs about Capabilities, Services, Etc.


Elevator Pitch (creative agencies and brands)


InterEcho is specifically focused on adapting marketing and advertising creative into other languages – content that does not easily translate and needs a much more holistic approach with cultural appropriateness in mind. Translation companies tend to be way too literal when handling marketing content, and they rarely offer international voiceover and video production services to see it all the way through, so InterEcho has filled this void for brands and creative agencies that operate globally.


Attached is our capabilities deck and here is a link to some of our recent campaign transcreation work to give you a feel for what we’re producing – https://interecho.com/our-work. 


In addition to video, we regularly localize websites, mobile apps, creative pitch decks, and other content related to our client’s global operations.


Elevator Pitch (market research companies)


InterEcho is specifically focused on adapting market research surveys and marketing creative into other languages – content that does not easily translate and needs a much more holistic approach with cultural appropriateness in mind. Translation companies tend to be way too literal when handling survey content, and they rarely offer full localization services to see it all the way through to survey respondents, so InterEcho has filled this void for brands and research agencies that operate globally. 
 
Attached is our capabilities deck and here is a link to some of our recent campaign transcreation work to give you a feel for the types of brands we work with – https://interecho.com/our-work. Although these samples highlight our video services, we regularly localize research surveys, websites, mobile apps, and other content related to our client’s global operations.




Elevator Pitch (training companies)


InterEcho is specifically focused on adapting training and development creative into other languages – content that does not easily translate and needs a much more holistic approach with cultural appropriateness in mind. Translation companies tend to be way too literal when handling training material, and they rarely offer voiceover and video production services to see it all the way through, so InterEcho has filled this void for brands and training companies that operate globally. 
 
Attached is our capabilities deck and here is a link to some of our recent campaign transcreation work to give you a feel for the types of brands we work with – https://interecho.com/our-work.  Although these samples highlight our creative services related to video, we regularly localize eLearning courses, LMS content, surveys, websites, and other content related to our client’s global training operations.




“Tell Me More About Your Services”


We’re quite a bit different than most translation companies that tend to service a lot of various industries and departments.  We’re focused strictly on marketing and advertising content, so our processes are designed to accommodate creative copy that doesn’t easily translate, as well as expedited deadlines that most advertisers must work under. We also have full-service production capabilities, so we regularly work with our client’s native creative assets and video masters so the work we deliver is market-ready.


We don’t really “translate” content per se.  Our resources are local copywriters that produce culturally relevant content that feels genuine and fluid in the target market.  Our goal is for the content we deliver to feel like it was originally crafted in the target language.  All of our linguistic resources are native-speakers of the target language and they reside in country to ensure the most current knowledge of cultural nuances, language proficiency, and local industry terminology. 


Attached is our capabilities deck and here is a link to some of our recent campaign transcreation work to give you a feel for what we’re producing – https://interecho.com/our-work. 




I don’t want to hear anymore. Just tell me your per word rates!


Cost for copy transcreation can range anywhere from $0.18/word to $0.42/word depending on target language, content volume, and deliverable requirements. To add some more perspective to this, I have attached an example of our transcreation deck, which is what you can expect to receive from us for in-language copy. 


Unlike most general translation companies, we always include English back-translations and commentary explaining our word choices so that you fully understand how the messaging is handled for each market.  Since we’re solely focused on adapting marketing and advertising content that is culturally nuanced and can’t be translated literally, the linguistic resources we utilize are more like in-language copywriters versus translators.


I have also included our capabilities deck and the following is a short list of our services. I appreciate your willingness to pass along our information to the appropriate parties.


-  Cultural Strategy
-  Copy Transcreation & Translation
-  Multilingual Voice Talent Casting, Voiceovers & Dubbing
-  On-Site Bilingual Producers & Post Supervisors
-  Video Editing & Subtitling
-  Web, Social, & Mobile Localization
- Global SEO and SEM

Email Playbook


Quick Question Email Templates


HARD RULES:
1. Subject line is always “quick question” in lowercase.
2. Always use the same email chain when you send QQ #2, #3, etc. Never start a new email chain on follow-ups.
3. Always include your e-signature.

I understand you’re trying to get a better feel for our pricing.  Our rates are contingent on many different factors including target language, creativity of the copy, deadline, overall volume, usage, etc., so we don’t have a general rate card per se.  The best way is to provide us with some content and we’ll provide you with a detailed cost proposal.  If you don’t have anything immediate, we’d be happy to quote on a past or mock project so that you can better compare us to your current solution.

Emails to use after discovery calls and to deliver bids


After a discovery call (with samples included)
- pull the most applicable sample from IESD > Sales > Samples > Transcreation Samples
- attach our creds deck


Hi [first name]


Nice to chat with you earlier and thanks again for taking a few minutes!


I’ve attached our creds deck, which contains a bit more detail on our services and links to some work samples. I have also attached an example of our Transcreation deliverable, which is what you can expect to receive from us when we’re translating any ad copy for scripts, banners, social posts, etc. This example is part of a social campaign we did for Facebook to promote their Instagram Stories feature globally. Although the headlines simple enough, you’ll see the level of care we take to ensure the translations play well in each market. Literal translations of this copy would have proved problematic.


As discussed, we focus exclusively on adapting creative into other languages – content that does not easily translate and needs a much more holistic approach with cultural relevance in mind. We work on all types of content, including TV commercials, print, websites, social posts, and digital ads. With end-to-end production capabilities, including global VO, audio design, and video services, we’re quite a bit different than a general translation company that’s not well equipped to handle native creative assets from start to finish. They also tend to translate ad copy way too literally, so the intended spirit and messaging gets lost. Our goal is to deliver accurate and culturally relevant content that feels as if was originally drafted and produced in the target language.


From a cost standpoint, I’m happy to provide a mock bid so that you can get a better feel for how we price services. Most of our clients have a lot of nuances in their specs and requirements, so we don’t really have a rate card in the traditional sense, but we can certainly establish something for [client/agency] specifically so that you can more easily budget for work coming down the pike.


Here is a short list of our services and I appreciate your willingness to share this with your Producers and colleagues.

-  Global Voice Talent Casting, Voiceovers & Dubbing
-  Bilingual Directors & Post Supervisors

Looking forward to staying in touch and finding something to work on together!

To include when you email a first time bid
- pull the most applicable sample from IESD > Sales > Samples > Transcreation Samples
- attached our creds deck


Hi [first name],


Attached is the bid to [description]. 


To better highlight what you can expect to receive from us as a copy deliverable, I have attached an example of our transcreation deck for [description – pull the most applicable one from our available samples]. In addition to the [target language] copy, our translation deliverables will always include English back-translations and rationale from our transcreation teams so that your creatives have a deeper understanding of how we adapted their copy. You’ll see the level of care we take to ensure the translations play well in each market, as literal translations are typically problematic and don’t take cultural relevance into account. We’re quite a bit different than most general translation companies in this regard.


In addition, I have attached our creds deck that details a bit more about us. We focus exclusively on adapting creative into other languages – content that does not easily translate and needs a much more holistic approach with cultural relevance in mind. We work on all types of content, including TV commercials, print, websites, social posts, and digital ads.

They also tend to translate ad copy way too literally, so the intended spirit and messaging gets lost. Our goal is to deliver accurate and culturally relevant content that feels as if was originally drafted and produced in the target language.


Let me know if you have any questions or if I can provide any further details. I’m looking forward to working with you on something!

“What do you do?”


InterEcho is solely focused on adapting English creative into other languages – content that does not easily translate and needs a much more holistic approach with cultural appropriateness in mind. Translation companies tend to be way too literal when handling ad copy, and they rarely offer VO and video production services to see it all the way through, so we have filled this void for creative agencies specifically.


Attached is our capabilities deck and here is a link to some of our recent campaign transcreation work to give you a feel for what we’re producing – https://interecho.com/our-work. 


Our main offerings are global VO production, video and website localization, and copy transcreation.


I’d appreciate you sharing this with your production teams. Please keep us in mind should any international challenges present themselves.


“Tell Me More About Your Services”


We’re quite a bit different than most translation companies that tend to service a lot of various industries and departments.  We’re focused strictly on marketing and advertising content, so our processes are designed to accommodate creative copy that doesn’t easily translate, as well as expedited deadlines that most advertisers must work under. We also have full-service production capabilities, so we regularly work with our client’s native creative assets and video masters so the work we deliver is market-ready.


We don’t really “translate” content per se.  Our resources are local copywriters that produce culturally relevant content that feels genuine and fluid in the target market.  Our goal is for the content we deliver to feel like it was originally crafted in the target language.  All of our linguistic resources are native-speakers of the target language and they reside in country to ensure the most current knowledge of cultural nuances, language proficiency, and local industry terminology. 


Attached is our capabilities deck and here is a link to some of our recent campaign transcreation work to give you a feel for what we’re producing – https://interecho.com/our-work. 




I don’t want to hear anymore. Just tell me your per word rates!


Cost for copy transcreation can range anywhere from $0.18/word to $0.42/word depending on target language, content volume, and deliverable requirements. To add some more perspective to this, I have attached an example of our transcreation deck, which is what you can expect to receive from us for in-language copy. 


Unlike most general translation companies, we always include English back-translations and commentary explaining our word choices so that you fully understand how the messaging is handled for each market.  Since we’re solely focused on adapting marketing and advertising content that is culturally nuanced and can’t be translated literally, the linguistic resources we utilize are more like in-language copywriters versus translators.


I have also included our capabilities deck and the following is a short list of our services. I appreciate your willingness to pass along our information to the appropriate parties.

-  Copy Transcreation & Translation
-  Multilingual Voice Talent Casting, Voiceovers & Dubbing

What is transcreation?


Transcreation is the process of adapting creative content into another language. When transcreating content, we rework the copy to ensure it feels organic, accessible, and genuine to the target audience. It differs from a more literal translation process in that it is strictly focused on creative content and is intended to capture the full intended meaning and tone of the original source content. You can think about in the same way as you would think about the difference between basic business writing and copywriting.
